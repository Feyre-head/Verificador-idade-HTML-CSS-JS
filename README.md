# General Explanation
- This code calculates a person's age based on the provided birth year and the current year.
- It identifies the gender and age group using radio buttons and selects a corresponding image.
- It displays the detected age and gender in the `res` element, along with the appropriate image.

# Key Concepts Reinforced in This Exercise

## HTML
- `input` type radio / checked

## CSS
- (Add any specific CSS elements you use here)

## JavaScript

### Date and Time
- **`new Date().getFullYear()`**: Creates a `Date` object representing the current date and time, extracting the current year using `getFullYear()`.

### DOM Manipulation
- **`document.getElementsByName("radsex")`**: Returns a NodeList containing all elements with the `name="radsex"` attribute, allowing you to identify the selected radio button (e.g., Male or Female).
- **Styling through JavaScript**: JavaScript can apply styles directly to elements, allowing dynamic adjustments to width, height, and other style properties.

### Element Creation
- **`document.createElement("img")`**: Creates an `<img>` element dynamically in the document. This allows you to add images to the page based on specific conditions.
  - **`img.setAttribute("id", "photo")`**: Assigns an `id` to the created `img` element, making it easier to reference or style it later if needed.
  - **`img.setAttribute("src", "path_to_image.png")`**: Sets the `src` attribute of the `<img>` element to specify the path to the image to be displayed. This path is adjusted based on the selected age group and gender.
  - **`res.appendChild(img)`**: Appends the created `<img>` element to the `res` element, adding the image to the end of any existing content within `res`.

### Data Conversion
- **`Number()`**: Converts the value of the birth year input (often received as a string) to a number, making it suitable for calculations.

### Control Structures (Conditionals)
- **`if` and `else if`**: These conditional statements are used to:
  - Validate the birth year input (checking if itâ€™s empty or a future year).
  - Determine the selected gender based on the checked radio button.
  - Select the appropriate image path based on the calculated age and selected gender.

This breakdown covers the main concepts and methods used in the code, demonstrating how to interact with the user, manipulate data, and dynamically update page content using JavaScript.
